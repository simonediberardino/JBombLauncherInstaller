# JBomb Launcher Installer

Welcome to the **JBomb Launcher** project! This application is designed to streamline the installation and launching of JBomb The Game by automatically checking for Java, downloading necessary files, and launching the game in a new console window.

## Features

- **Java Detection**: Automatically checks if Java is installed on your system.
- **Java Installation**: If Java is not detected, the launcher will download and install it for you.
- **JBomb Launcher Download**: Automatically downloads the latest version of the JBomb Launcher if it's not already installed.

## Requirements

- **Windows OS**: This application is designed to run on Windows due to its reliance on Windows-specific libraries.

## Note
